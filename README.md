# The `aruco_markers` library

All the functionality of the library can be accessed via

```python
import aruco_markers
```

Full documentation for all the classes/functions provided can be found [here]().

# Command line interface

Several features of the library are exposed to the command line via the `aruco` command.
When running these commands, several directories will be created.
The top level directory is `~/aruco_markers_data`.
All the data created by these commands are stored here, specified in the following sub-sections.

The available commands are
* `collect`: Collect data with checkerboard to calibrate a camera.
* `calibrate`: Calibrate a camera.
* `generate`: Generate marker tags.
* `detect`: Detect marker poses from camera feed.

The use of these commands are described below.
In addition, you can access the documentation for ecah command by appending `--help`.
For example
```
$ aruco generate --help
usage: aruco generate [OPTIONS]

Generate marker tags.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DICT, --dict DICT  Type of ArUCo tag to generate (default is DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL).
  -i ID, --id ID        Identifier of the marker. It has to be a valid id in the specified dictionary.
  -s SIDEPIXELS, --sidepixels SIDEPIXELS
                        Size of the ArUCo tag (default is 200).
  -b BORDERBITS, --borderbits BORDERBITS
                        Width of the marker border (default is 1).
  -w WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                        Width of the marker in millimeters (default is 500).
  -p PAD, --pad PAD     Padding around marker image when positioned on an A4 pdf in millimeters (default is 20).
  --noshow              Display the marker.
  --save                Save the marker. Tags are saved in ~/aruco_markers/tags; this directory is created if it does not already exist.
```

Similarly for each of the other commands.

## Generating markers

You can generate markers using the `aruco generate` command.
When the `--save` flag is included in the command line input, the marker data is saved in the `~/aruco_markers_data/tags` directory.
Two files are created, an image of the marker as a PNG and a printable PDF.
The PDF includes the tag and meta information as human-readable text.

For example, try running
```
$ aruco generate --dict DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL --id 100 --save --noshow
```

The expected output is as follows (note `HOMEDIR` will be relaced with what ever your home directory is set as).

```
Created HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data
Created HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/tags
Saved
  HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/tags/marker_dict_DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL_id_100_sidepixels_200_borderbits_1_width_500_pad_20.png
  HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/tags/marker_dict_DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL_id_100_sidepixels_200_borderbits_1_width_500_pad_20.pdf
```

*Note*, if you have already run `aruco generate` before, then it is possible you will not see the lines acknowledging a directories creation (i.e. those starting with `Created`).

The PNG file created should match the marker displayed at the top of this readme, i.e. [here](doc/marker.png).

The full list of available dictionaries are as follows.

* DICT_4X4_50
* DICT_4X4_100
* DICT_4X4_250
* DICT_4X4_1000
* DICT_5X5_50
* DICT_5X5_100
* DICT_5X5_250
* DICT_5X5_1000
* DICT_6X6_50
* DICT_6X6_100
* DICT_6X6_250
* DICT_6X6_1000
* DICT_7X7_50
* DICT_7X7_100
* DICT_7X7_250
* DICT_7X7_1000
* DICT_ARUCO_ORIGINAL
* DICT_APRILTAG_16h5
* DICT_APRILTAG_25h9
* DICT_APRILTAG_36h10
* DICT_APRILTAG_36h11

## Calibrating a camera

Calibrating a camera can be performed using the `aruco collect` and  `aruco calibrate` command.
Running this command will take you through several steps in order to calibrate the camera.

### Prerequisites

You will require a checkerboard to complete the calibration process.
A good resource for getting printable checkerboards can be found [here](https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection).
It is a good idea to attach the printed checkerboard to a flat surface.

You can also find a checkerboard in the `doc/` directory called `Checkerboard-A4-25mm-8x6.pdf`.
This is a 8-by-6 checkerboard, where each square has length 25mm when printed on A4.

### Collect data

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/image/checkerboard.png" width="60%" align="center">
</p>

To gather data for calibration, execute the `aruco collect` command.
When the checkerboard is detected correctly, a result similar to the one depicted in the above figure should appear.
Press the ESC key to stop collecting data.

To obtain accurate estimated parameters from the calibration process, it is advisable to move the checkerboard to different depths and orientations on the screen.
Keep in mind that a considerable amount of data could be collected, so make sure that your PC has sufficient storage capacity.
The quantity of data required is uncertain, but collecting more data will generally result in more precise estimated parameters.
Nevertheless, processing more data will take more time.
Ensuring sufficient coverage of depths and orientations is important.

In this particular example, I used the `Checkerboard-A4-25mm-8x6.pdf` found in the `doc/` directory for the checkerboard.
Since I am using my laptop's webcam, the camera index is `0` (which is the default value).
I began the data collection process by executing the following command.

```
$ aruco collect --width 8 --height 6 --squaresize 25
```

Run `$ aruco collect --help` if you need more clarity on the command line input variables.

You should expect terminal output similar to the following.

```
$ aruco collect --width 8 --height 6 --squaresize 25
Press ESC to quit.
Created HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data
Created HOMEDIR/home/cm22/aruco_markers_data/calibrate
Created HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/calibrate/CAMERANAME
Data collection completed for the 'CAMERANAME' camera.
Data saved in HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/calibrate/CAMERANAME
```

In the above, `HOMEDIR` is your home directory, i.e. where ever `~/` is on you PC, and `CAMERANAME` is the camera name used for data collection.
This should correspond to the camera you intend to calibrate (if you have more than one camera attached to your PC).
Note the `CAMERANAME`, it will be required in the calibration step next.

All the raw images that contain the checkerboard are collected into a zip file called `data.zip`.
You can run the collection process several times, and the new data is appended to the zip file (the collection *does not* overwrite previously collected data).

### Calibrate camera

Once you have collected data (as described in the previous section), you can directly perform the calibration.
All you require is the name of the camera (this was ouput to the terminal during the data collection, see `CAMERANAME` in previous section).

In my example, I ran the following.

```
$ aruco calibrate --cameraname CAMERANAME
```

The terminal output should look similar to the following.

```
$ aruco calibrate --cameraname CAMERANAME
Processing checkerboard images ...

  -7.64518705e+00]]
Saved HOMEDIR/aruco_markers_data/calibrate/CAMERANAME/camera_parameters.dat
Completed calibration successfully.
```

In the above, 60 files were successfully processed.
*Note*, each file name is given a unique time stamp so files are not overwritten.
The duration of the calibration process is reported and also the estimated parameters.
You do not need to note these since they are saved in the `camera_parameters.dat` file.

If you have a lot of data and the processing is taking too long, you can downsample the data by specifying the `--maxfiles MAXFILES` flag.
This will randomly sample `MAXFILES` files from the file names (uniform distribution) and then perform the calibration.

## View pose detection from a camera feed

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/image/marker_ex.png" width="60%" align="center">
</p>

After calibrating a camera, you can use the `aruco detect` command to display the position of a marker.
This function is primarily intended for debugging and serves as a demonstration of detector configuration.
However, if the camera has not been calibrated beforehand, this command will throw an error.

When you run `aruco detect` you should see something similar to the figure above.
I ran this example by running the following in terminal.

```
$ aruco detect --dict DICT_4X4_50 --markerindex 0
```

*Note*, the marker I use in this example has a length of 5cm.
This information is required if you want to use the pose estimation.

# Marker pose estimation

If you opt for the `aruco_markers` package, you can use the command line interface to produce tags and calibrate cameras.
However, if you require additional features, you can customize the class/method structure available in the library.
Several methods are provided to that enable you to easily load camera parameters, and estimate marker poses.

Please see the [example](example/ros1_tf_publisher.py), that shows how to implement a simple pose estimator into ROS.
This example assumes you have calibrated your camera by running `aruco collect`, and `aruco calibrate` prior to running this script.
